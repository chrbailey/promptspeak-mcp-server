# UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
# NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA

**JANE DOE,**
Plaintiff,

v.                                          Case No. 3:24-cv-01234

**ACME CORPORATION,**
Defendant.

# PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff Jane Doe, by and through undersigned counsel, respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a).

## I. INTRODUCTION

This employment discrimination case presents a clear pattern of retaliation following Plaintiff's protected whistleblower activity. The undisputed facts demonstrate that Defendant terminated Plaintiff within three weeks of her internal complaint, satisfying the temporal proximity standard established in *Yartzoff v. Thomas*, 809 F.2d 1371, 1376 (9th Cir. 1987).

## II. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS

1. Plaintiff was employed by Defendant from January 2020 through March 2024.

2. On February 15, 2024, Plaintiff reported suspected securities violations to Defendant's compliance department.

3. On March 8, 2024, Defendant terminated Plaintiff's employment, citing "restructuring."

4. Defendant's stated reason is pretextual. As the Supreme Court held in *McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green*, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate reason.

5. Internal emails obtained in discovery reveal that Defendant's CEO wrote: "We need to get rid of the troublemaker before she causes more problems."

## III. LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. *Celotex Corp. v. Catrett*, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).

## IV. ARGUMENT

### A. Plaintiff Established a Prima Facie Case of Retaliation

Under the framework established in *Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White*, 548 U.S. 53 (2006), a plaintiff must show: (1) protected activity, (2) adverse employment action, and (3) a causal connection.

Here, all three elements are satisfied:

1. **Protected Activity**: Plaintiff's internal complaint about securities violations constitutes protected activity under the Dodd-Frank Act. *Digital Realty Trust, Inc. v. Somers*, 583 U.S. 149 (2018).

2. **Adverse Action**: Termination is the quintessential adverse employment action. *Thompson v. Johnson & Johnson*, 627 F.3d 876 (9th Cir. 2019).

3. **Causal Connection**: The three-week temporal proximity between complaint and termination establishes causation. *Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc.*, 281 F.3d 1054, 1065 (9th Cir. 2002).

### B. Defendant's Stated Reason Is Pretextual

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT

The "restructuring" justification fails for several reasons:

1. No other employees were terminated during the alleged restructuring.
2. Plaintiff's position was filled within two weeks of her departure.
3. The CEO's email directly references Plaintiff's complaint.

As this Court recognized in *Patterson v. Tech Industries*, 892 F.3d 1105 (N.D. Cal. 2022), such direct evidence of discriminatory animus is sufficient to defeat summary judgment in the employer's favor.

### C. Damages

Plaintiff is entitled to:
- Back pay from March 2024 to present
- Front pay for a reasonable period
- Compensatory damages for emotional distress
- Punitive damages given the egregious nature of the retaliation
- Attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988

## V. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant summary judgment in her favor on her retaliation claim.
