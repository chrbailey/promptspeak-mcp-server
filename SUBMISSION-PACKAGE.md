### Abstract (250 words max for SSRN)
```
This memorandum analyzes the evolving legal landscape for challenging
"acqui-hire" transactions—acquisitions structured primarily to acquire
founders and key team members while leaving venture capital investors
and option holders with minimal recovery.

Drawing on systematic research of Delaware case law via the CourtListener
API, this analysis synthesizes recent Delaware Supreme Court decisions
that have reshaped fiduciary duty litigation in M&A contexts. Key cases
examined include Tornetta v. Musk (Tesla compensation litigation), In re
Mindbody, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, In re Columbia Pipeline Group
Merger Litigation, and In re Match Group Derivative Litigation.

The memo identifies five critical developments: (1) entire fairness
review remains applicable when founders/directors are on both sides of
transactions; (2) acquirer liability for aiding and abetting has been
substantially narrowed, now requiring actual knowledge of both the
breach and the wrongfulness of the acquirer's own conduct; (3) rescission
remedies may be unavailable post-consummation, requiring plaintiffs to
propose alternative remedies; (4) standing for derivative dilution claims
is lost upon merger following Brookfield; and (5) option holder claims
remain primarily contractual.

The analysis provides practitioners with a framework for evaluating
potential causes of action, including breach of fiduciary duty, Revlon
violations, fraudulent transfer claims, and contract-based theories.
Using the Tesla/xAI shareholder litigation as a contemporary example,
the memo illustrates how these legal standards apply to transactions
where controllers may extract value at the expense of minority
stakeholders.

## EMAIL 1: Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance

**To:** forumeditors@corpgov.law.harvard.edu
**Subject:** Submission: Fiduciary Duty Framework for Acqui-Hire Transactions

```
Dear Forum Editors,

I am writing to submit for your consideration a legal memorandum
analyzing fiduciary duty issues in "acqui-hire" transactions, prepared
by ERP Access, Inc.

SUMMARY

The memo provides a practitioner's framework for evaluating claims
arising from acquisitions structured to benefit founders and key
employees while leaving investors and option holders with minimal
recovery. This pattern—exemplified by the ongoing Tesla/xAI shareholder
litigation—raises significant questions under Delaware's entire fairness
doctrine.

METHODOLOGY

The research was conducted using systematic queries of the CourtListener
REST API (v4), covering Delaware Court of Chancery and Supreme Court
decisions from 2021-2026. All 15 primary case citations have been
independently verified against Justia and official court records.

KEY CASES ANALYZED

- Tornetta v. Musk, 310 A.3d 430 (Del. Ch. 2024), rev'd on remedy,
  No. 534, 2024 (Del. Dec. 19, 2025)
- In re Mindbody, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, 332 A.3d 349 (Del. 2024)
- In re Columbia Pipeline Group Merger Litigation (Del. June 17, 2025)
- In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative Litigation, 315 A.3d 446 (Del. 2024)
- Brookfield Asset Management, Inc. v. Rosson, 261 A.3d 1251 (Del. 2021)

RELEVANCE TO FORUM READERS

The memo addresses the practical implications of the Delaware Supreme
Court's recent narrowing of aiding and abetting liability (Mindbody,
Columbia Pipeline) and the remedy limitations established in the Tesla
compensation litigation—topics of immediate interest to corporate
practitioners, in-house counsel, and academics.

The analysis is approximately 8,000 words with full citation appendices.

I have attached the memorandum in PDF format. Please let me know if you
require any additional information or revisions.

Thank you for your consideration.

## EMAIL 2: The D&O Diary (Kevin LaCroix)

**To:** [Contact via dandodiary.com contact form]
**Subject:** Guest Post Submission: D&O Implications of Acqui-Hire Structures

```
Dear Mr. LaCroix,

I've been a regular reader of The D&O Diary and noted your openness to
guest post submissions. I'd like to offer a piece that I believe would
interest your readers.

PROPOSED TOPIC

"Acqui-Hire Transactions and D&O Exposure: Lessons from Tornetta,
Mindbody, and Columbia Pipeline"

THE ANGLE

When founders structure "acqui-hire" deals that benefit themselves at
the expense of investors, what are the realistic liability exposures
for directors and officers? My analysis examines recent Delaware
Supreme Court decisions that have both clarified and constrained the
available claims.

KEY POINTS FOR D&O AUDIENCE

1. GOOD NEWS: Aiding and abetting liability against acquirers now
   requires actual knowledge of wrongfulness (Mindbody, Columbia
   Pipeline)—limiting third-party exposure

2. BAD NEWS: Target-side fiduciaries remain fully exposed under entire
   fairness when they're on both sides of the deal (Match Group
   independence requirements)

3. REMEDY RISK: Even winning plaintiffs may recover only nominal
   damages if they fail to propose alternatives to rescission
   (Tesla Dec. 2025)

4. STANDING TRAP: Directors may escape derivative claims entirely if
   deal closes before suit is filed (Brookfield)

I've prepared a comprehensive analysis with verified citations that
could be adapted to your format (approximately 2,500-3,500 words for
blog length, or I can provide the full 8,000-word memo).

Would this be of interest? I'm happy to revise the angle or focus based
on your editorial preferences.

🧵 THREAD: The Legal Landscape for Challenging "Acqui-Hire" Deals

When founders get rich and VCs get nothing, what can investors do?

We analyzed 20+ Delaware cases. Here's what we found:

(1/12)

---

The pattern:
• Acquirer wants the TEAM, not the company
• Founders get retention packages worth 10x the acquisition price
• Investors get pennies on the dollar
• Option holders get nothing

Sound familiar?

(2/12)

---

KEY CASE #1: Tornetta v. Musk

Delaware found Musk breached fiduciary duties in his $56B pay package.

BUT: Supreme Court reversed the remedy (Dec. 2025).

Lesson: Even WINNING plaintiffs may get only $1 if they don't propose
workable alternatives to rescission.

(3/12)

---

KEY CASE #2: In re Mindbody (Del. 2024)

CEO liability for Revlon breach? AFFIRMED ✅
Acquirer liability for aiding & abetting? REVERSED ❌

New standard: Acquirer must have ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE that its own conduct
was wrongful.

(4/12)

---

KEY CASE #3: Columbia Pipeline (Del. June 2025)

$200M judgment against acquirer? REVERSED.

Court: "Subtle and unintentional signals" from sell-side fiduciaries
are NOT enough for acquirer liability.

Acquirers just got a huge safe harbor.

(5/12)

---

So what CAN investors do?

✅ Entire fairness review when founders on both sides
✅ Revlon claims against target-side fiduciaries
✅ Disclosure violations
✅ Fraudulent transfer (if company insolvent)
✅ Contract claims for option holders

(6/12)

---

What's HARDER now:

❌ Aiding & abetting claims against acquirers
❌ Rescission as a remedy
❌ Derivative claims after deal closes (Brookfield killed dual-natured claims)

(7/12)

---

PRACTICAL ADVICE for VCs:

Before the deal:
• Negotiate protective provisions
• Ensure board representation
• Consider "acqui-hire protection" clauses

(8/12)

---

During the deal:
• Demand special committee process
• Require fairness opinion
• Document ALL side arrangements

After the deal:
• Preserve standing (don't tender if possible)
• File 220 demand for books & records
• Consider appraisal rights

(9/12)

---

For OPTION HOLDERS:

Your rights are primarily CONTRACTUAL.

Review your plan documents for:
• Change-of-control acceleration
• Double-trigger requirements
• Anti-dilution protections
