## THE THREAD

---

### TWEET 1 (Hook)
```
When founders get rich from an "acquisition" and VCs get nothing, what legal recourse exists?

We analyzed 20+ Delaware cases on acqui-hire transactions.

Here's what we found 🧵
```
*Characters: 214*

---

### TWEET 2 (The Pattern)
```
THE PATTERN:

• Acquirer wants the team, not the company
• Founders get retention packages worth 10x the deal price
• VCs get pennies on the dollar
• Option holders get zero

Sound familiar?
```
*Characters: 213*

---

### TWEET 3 (Key Case 1)
```
KEY CASE #1: Tornetta v. Musk

Delaware found Musk breached fiduciary duties in his $56B Tesla pay package.

BUT the Supreme Court reversed the remedy (Dec 2025).

Result: $1 in damages.

Lesson: Even WINNING may not help.
```
*Characters: 271*

---

### TWEET 4 (Why Remedy Failed)
```
Why only $1?

The court said Musk's 6 years of performance couldn't be "unscrambled."

Plaintiff's mistake: didn't propose workable alternatives to rescission.

New rule: You must tell the court exactly what remedy you want.
```
*Characters: 262*

---

### TWEET 5 (Key Case 2)
```
KEY CASE #2: In re Mindbody (Del. 2024)

CEO breached Revlon duties by not maximizing value ✓
Private equity buyer aided the breach? ✗ REVERSED

New standard: Acquirer needs ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE their conduct was wrong.
```
*Characters: 256*

---

### TWEET 6 (Key Case 3)
```
KEY CASE #3: Columbia Pipeline (Del. June 2025)

Trial court: $200M judgment against acquirer
Supreme Court: REVERSED

"Subtle and unintentional signals" from sell-side fiduciaries aren't enough.

Acquirers just got a massive safe harbor.
```
*Characters: 270*

---

### TWEET 7 (What This Means)
```
What this means for investors:

❌ Suing the acquirer? Very hard now
❌ Expecting rescission? Probably unavailable
❌ Waiting until after closing? May lose standing

The paths are narrowing.
```
*Characters: 223*

---

### TWEET 8 (What Still Works)
```
What STILL works:

✅ Entire fairness claims against conflicted insiders
✅ Revlon claims against target-side board
✅ Disclosure violation claims
✅ Fraudulent transfer (if company was insolvent)
✅ Contract claims for option holders
```
*Characters: 268*

---

### TWEET 9 (Standing Warning)
```
STANDING WARNING:

Brookfield v. Rosson (2021) killed "dual-natured" claims.

If the deal closes before you sue, you may lose standing entirely.

The dilution happened to the company. You're no longer a shareholder of that company.
```
*Characters: 264*

---

### TWEET 10 (Option Holders)
```
FOR OPTION HOLDERS:

Your rights are almost entirely contractual.

Check your plan docs for:
• Change-of-control acceleration
• Double-trigger provisions
• Anti-dilution protections

If it's not in the contract, you likely have nothing.
```
*Characters: 268*

---

### TWEET 11 (Practical Advice)
```
PRACTICAL ADVICE:

Before: Negotiate protective provisions when you invest

During: Demand special committee + fairness opinion + document everything

After: File 220 demand, consider appraisal rights, act FAST

If you want a more compact thread:

---

### SHORT 1
```
Founders walk away rich. VCs get nothing. Option holders get zero.

Welcome to the "acqui-hire."

We analyzed 20+ Delaware cases. Here's the legal reality 🧵
```
*Characters: 178*

---

### SHORT 2
```
BAD NEWS:

• Acquirer liability just got way harder (Mindbody, Columbia Pipeline)
• Rescission may be unavailable even if you win (Tornetta)
• Standing disappears at closing (Brookfield)
```
*Characters: 213*

---

### SHORT 3
```
GOOD NEWS:

• Entire fairness still applies to conflicted insiders
• Target-side fiduciaries remain exposed
• Contract claims for option holders still viable
• Acting before closing preserves options
```
*Characters: 230*

---

### SHORT 4
```
The Tesla case in one stat:

Court found Musk breached fiduciary duties.

Damages awarded: $1

Why? Plaintiff didn't propose a workable alternative to rescission.

New rule: Tell courts exactly what remedy you want.
```
*Characters: 241*

---

### SHORT 5
```
Key cases to know:

• Tornetta v. Musk - remedy limits
• Mindbody - acquirer safe harbor
• Columbia Pipeline - no constructive knowledge
• Match Group - special committee must be truly independent
• Brookfield - standing rules
```
